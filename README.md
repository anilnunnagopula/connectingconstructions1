## 🧠 Project Vision

**ConnectingConstructions** is a large-scale digital platform built to bridge civil engineers, builders, and construction suppliers — offering a unified space for product listings, labor bookings, and all civil-related requirements.

Inspired by the idea of **“Amazon for Builders”**, this platform streamlines the construction material discovery and procurement process.

## 🔥 Target Users

- 🏢 **Suppliers**  
  Register & list products like cement, steel, paints, trucks, borewells, etc. Add location data via Google Maps for discovery.

- 👷‍♂️ **Builders / Customers**  
  Browse by category, filter products, and directly contact nearby suppliers.

- 🧑‍💼 **Admin Panel (Internal)**  
  Manage listings, approve suppliers, track orders, and maintain data integrity.
